## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an automated system for measuring, analyzing, and visualizing energy consumption data. The solution will enhance efficiency, accuracy, and ease of understanding in managing energy consumption across various sectors.

## Features

1. **Predictive Modeling**: The system will use machine learning models to predict future energy consumption.
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: Users can interact with the data, change variables, and see the impact on predictions.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: The system will identify unusual energy consumption patterns and alert decision-makers for immediate action.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI_Phase1.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AI_Phase1`
3. Install necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
