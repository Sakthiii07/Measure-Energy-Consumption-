## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the management of energy consumption data by developing an automated system for measuring, analyzing, predicting, and visualizing energy usage. Our goal is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making across various sectors by harnessing the power of data science and machine learning.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

In Phase 1, we defined the problem and outlined our design thinking process. We identified the manual, time-consuming, and error-prone nature of energy consumption data collection and analysis as the core issue. The key features and steps envisioned at this stage include:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning models to predict future energy consumption.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Creating a user-friendly dashboard for data exploration and impact analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing mechanisms to identify unusual consumption patterns.
- **Data Automation**: Automating data collection, analysis, and visualization processes.

### Phase 2: Innovation and Practical Steps

In Phase 2, we detailed the practical steps needed to bring our project to life, with a focus on innovation and efficiency. This phase includes:

- **Data Collection and Enrichment**: Selecting a suitable dataset and supplementing it with external data sources like weather and holiday data to gain comprehensive insights.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features and metrics to better understand energy consumption patterns.

- **Model Development**: Creating machine learning models, including XGBoost Regressor, LSTM Networks, and CNN-RNN hybrids, to predict future energy consumption.

- **Visualization**: Building an interactive dashboard using Tableau for data exploration and variable impact analysis.

- **Automation**: Developing a Python script to automate data collection, analysis, and visualization for increased efficiency.
